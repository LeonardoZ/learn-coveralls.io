===============

Coveralls tracks code coverage in your Node.JS & Client JS projects

## Intro

### What is Code Coverage?

Code coverage is a measure used to describe the degree to which  
source code is tested by a test suite. 
A program with high code coverage has been more thoroughly tested 
and has a *lower chance* of containing software *bugs* than a program
with low code coverage.

### Why is Code Coverage Important?

While having 100% code coverage *does* ***not guarantee*** that your code is
free from *any* bugs, it does ensure that every line is 
being "exercised" so there is *less likelihood* of ***unexpected behaviour***. 

This ***reduces uncertainty*** *and* ***increases confidence*** in the code 
written by everyone on your team.
So when a bug does *inevitably* get discovered, you know


### What is Coveralls

Coveralls is a code coverage checking service. <br />
It does one thing well: tracking code coverage. <br />
It's *free* for open source projects so get started *today*!

### Coveralls Pricing for "Private" (Closed Source) Projects

Like Travis CI, Coveralls is ***free for open source*** projects. <br />
Unlike Travis CI, Coveralls is "only"
