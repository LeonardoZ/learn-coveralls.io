Coveralls tracks code coverage in your Node.JS & Client JS projects

## Intro

### What is Code Coverage?

Code coverage is a measure used to describe the degree to which the 
source code of a program is tested by a particular test suite. 
A program with high code coverage has been more thoroughly tested 
and has a lower chance of containing software bugs than a program 
with low code coverage.

### Why is Code Coverage Important?

While having 100% code coverage *does* ***not guarantee*** that you will not 
have *any* bugs in your code it does ensure that every line is 
being "exercised" so there is less likelihood of unexpected behaviour. 

This reduces uncertainty and increases confidence in your code.
So when a bug does *inevitably* get discovered, you know


Coveralls is a code coverage checking service that is *free* for open source
projects. It does one thing well: tracking code coverage.
